## 🌳 IOTA Streams Initiative

The **IOTA Streams Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Streams](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## 🎯 Initiative Goals

The IOTA Streams is in its alpha implementation. We are currently focused on improving the developer experience around the following four goals:

- Quality Assurance/Review
- Documentation
- Code samples development
- Improvements to module/libraries

### Quality Assurance/Review

Quality Assurance/Review goal includes making sure that the releases are easily usable, has no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn developers off from trying further once they run into them, make sure that the examples we provide are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for quality assurance/review here →]

### Documentation

Community content goal includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content around with solid documentation at every launch, that is kept up-to-date, well-written explanations of tangible use cases to stimulate developer interest

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for documentation here →]

### Code samples development

Community contributions goal includes Code examples and well-presented PoCs to kick start devs Create a list of RFP’s for the EDF to fund Open-Source development

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for code samples development here →]

###  Improvements to module/libraries

Community contributions goal includes Developer-friendly APIs at launch Solid comms both at release and after release (e.g. spotlight for community projects using each of libs)
